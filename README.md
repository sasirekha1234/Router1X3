# Router1X3

This repository contains the RTL design and UVM verification environment for a 1x3 Router project. The router is designed to route packets from a single input port to three output ports based on the header information.

 # Project Overview

The Router 1x3 is a digital design that:

Routes packets from one input port to three output ports
Uses FIFOs for output buffering (16x9 bits each)
Implements parity checking for error detection
Features a FSM-based control system
